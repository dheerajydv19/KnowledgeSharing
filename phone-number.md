Phone Number 
As we all are living in the 21st century so, i hope all of you are already familiar with what phone number is and how exactly this technologies works.
But what we are gonna learn in this repo is something rare that you have ever heard off.

How phone numbers got hacked?
Have you ever read in any newspaper that someone's phone number got hacked?
Can you think how it would have been happened?

Genral public considers hacking phone number's a very big hack like something that is too difficult and impossible, but it isn't. Let me explain you how all these things actulaly happen.

#### Can you call someone by any number(infact by his own too)?
Yes, its possible and can be done easily by using some phone number spoofinng app. What actually happens in this, you just download any phone number spoofing app, enter the phone number you wanted to spoof and whom you wanted to call. Click on call and yeah, the reciever will see the nnumber you wanted him to saw.
This is not hacking, it can be done by kids. Thieir exists a lot of websites too for this purpose, i am not going to mention any of this, since i dont want to promote any illegal thing.

#### How to know if the number is spoofed?
When someone calls you  by spoofing any number, if you disconnect the call and callback to the original owner of that number, so you can just ask the person that his voice is lagging an d you calling him back, if the same person is on other side, this isn't a spoofed call.

#### How people calls you via any number that starts with a country code different from your country?
Yeah, its what we call VOIP number. What exactly happens in this case is, people download apps like textnow, 2ndLine and purchase a temporary non Voip number from their. so, they can now call you via that or can message you or can use whatsapp number on that. Totally depends on from which app you purchased it and for how much.
Note- In most of the cases, these non voip numbers are used by scammmers or cybercriminals only, so i personally suggest never pick any call from any number having country code different than yours until you are not sure that its number of any of your known ones.

#### How people get otp for banking frauds?
From last one year, their is a new thing in illegal market which we call otp hack bot. what this bot does?
It asks you to enter the number of your victim, the bank in which your victim has a account and his name, and it calls on that number and plays a script in robotic voice where it claims to be calling from the bank and tries to convice you for sharing otp for any kind of verification.
Some scammers do it manually too, so stay safe from those too.

#### Can your sim card be hacked?
Yeah, what actually happens in this case, if you keep your phone number switched off and go to customer care and tell them any imaginery story and if you can convince them to issue you a new sim card with same number, they will do it.
Previously scammers were abusing this loopholes and creating new sim card with victim's number and were using that for receiving otp for doing a banking fraud.

#### Can your sim card be spoofed?
Yeah, sim card swapping is also possible, it can be done if attacker has physical access to your sim card and have specialized hardware and software for this.

#### Can someone tap you number?
Yeah, the police and some sim card issuing company employees can who have permission for this after they get legal pemission from court or from any high authority.
The other way of doing it is call forwarding. It can be done by anyone who got access to your dialpad, he will just dial a code and boom, you are in big danger now.

That's it for today, hope you enjoyed it.
